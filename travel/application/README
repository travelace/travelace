I've created this library because I've several times need to authenticate
users against LDAP for projects I've been working on.  I had a hard time find-
ing an LDAP authentication module for CodeIgniter, so I ended up writing my
own to fill this seemingly omnipresent need.

Some code "borrowed" (ldap_escape(), to be precise) from php.net contributed
in the user comments for
ldap_search() by "douglass_davis [at] earthlink dot net."
